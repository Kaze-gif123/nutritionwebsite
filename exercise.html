    <p>Regular physical exercise plays an important role in maintaining a healthy body and mind. Activities such as walking, running, or playing sports help strengthen muscles, improve heart health, and increase energy levels. Exercise also reduces stress and supports mental well-being, making it an important part of a balanced lifestyle.
In addition, staying physically active helps maintain a healthy weight, improves flexibility, and boosts overall endurance. Regular exercise can enhance sleep quality, increase self-confidence, and lower the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease and diabetes. Choosing activities that are enjoyable and suitable for individual fitness levels makes it easier to stay consistent. By incorporating movement into daily routines, people can build long-term habits that promote strength, resilience, and overall well-being.</p>
