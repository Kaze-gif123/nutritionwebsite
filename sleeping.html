    <p>Good sleeping habits are essential for the body to rest, repair, and recharge. Getting enough quality sleep each night improves memory, concentration, mood, and overall health. Maintaining a regular sleep schedule and creating a calm bedtime routine can help ensure the body receives the rest it needs to function effectively during the day.
Adequate sleep also supports a strong immune system, balances hormones, and reduces stress levels. Limiting screen time before bed, keeping the sleeping environment quiet and comfortable, and avoiding caffeine late in the day can further improve sleep quality. By prioritizing rest and making sleep a consistent part of a healthy lifestyle, individuals can enhance both their physical performance and mental well-being.</p>
